0.Factorize all the things!
#### 0\. Factorize all the things!#advanced

Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

-   Usage:`factors <file>`
    -   where`<file>`is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
    -   One number per line
    -   You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1
    -   You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number
    -   The file will always end with a new line
-   Output format:`n=p*q`
    -   one factorization per line
    -   `p`and`q`don't have to be prime numbers
    -   See example
-   You can work on the numbers of the file in the order of your choice
-   Your program should run without any dependency: You will not be able to install anything on the machine we will run your program on
-   Time limit: Your program will be killed after 5 seconds if it hasn't finish
-   Push all your scripts, source code, etc... to your repository
    -   we will only run your executable`factors`

#### 1\. RSA Factoring Challenge#advanced

RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number`n`, there exist prime numbers`p`and`q`such that

`n`=`p`Ã—`q`. The problem is to find these two primes, given only`n`.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

-   `p`and`q`are always prime numbers
-   There is only one number in the files

How far can you go in less than 5 seconds?
